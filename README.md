## Markdown Tagging Options

In Markdown, you can use various tagging options to format your text, create lists, add links and images, and more. Below are some of the common tagging options you can use:

### Headers

Headers are created using the `#` symbol before your text. The number of `#` symbols used will determine the size of the header.

\# Header 1
\## Header 2
\### Header 3
\#### Header 4
\##### Header 5
\###### Header 6

### Emphasis

You can emphasize text by making it bold or italic.

- **Bold**: Add `**` or `__` before and after your text.

  \**This is bold text**
  \__This is also bold text__

- *Italic*: Add `*` or `_` before and after your text.

  \*This text is italicized*
  \_This text is also italicized_

### Lists

Create ordered and unordered lists for better organization of information.

- Unordered Lists: Start a line with `*`, `-`, or `+`.
  
  \* Item 1
  \* Item 2
  \* Item 3

- Ordered Lists: Start a line with a number followed by a dot.
  
  \1. First Item
  \2. Second Item
  \3. Third Item

### Links and Images

Add links and images to enrich your document.

- Links: Use the format `[Link Text](URL)` to create hyperlinks.

  \[Google](https://www.google.com)

- Images: Use the format `![Alt Text](Image URL)` to embed images.

  \![Sample Image](image_url.jpg)

### Code

Include code snippets using backticks.

- Inline Code: Enclose the code with a single backtick on each side.

  \`Inline code snippet`

- Code Blocks: Enclose multiple lines of code with three backticks or indent with four spaces.

  \```
  Code block
  Multiple lines of code
  \```

### Blockquotes

Use the `>` symbol for blockquotes.
